Circle Area Calculator
----------------------

This is a simple Python program made in a compiler that calculates the area of a circle
based on user input.

How it works:
1. Prompts the user to enter the diameter of the circle.
2. Calculates the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.
3. Squares the radius.
4. Multiplies the squared radius by π (math.pi) to find the area.
5. Prints the area along with a detailed explanation of the steps:
   - How the diameter was halved to get the radius.
   - How the radius was squared.
   - How the result was multiplied by π to get the final area.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Built-in 'math' module (no additional libraries needed)

Example Usage:
> What is the diameter? 10
> The area of the circle is 78.53981633974483, this is an exact number for all digits of pi,
> how we solved it is we halved 10 to be 5.0 and squared that to be 25.0 and multiplied it by π
> to get 78.53981633974483

This program is great for quickly calculating circle areas while showing step-by-step
how the calculation is performed.
